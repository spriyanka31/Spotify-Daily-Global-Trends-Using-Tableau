## Data Collection
To create the Spotify dashboard, data was collected from **SpotifyCharts.com**, focusing on real-time music trends across 25+ countries. The following steps were undertaken for data collection:
1. **Identifying Data Sources**: Selected Spotify Charts to obtain insights into popular music trends in different regions.
2. **Extracting Data**: Gathered data that included track names, artists, play counts, and ranking positions for the top 200 songs across various playlists.
3. **Data Format**: The collected data was organized into a structured format (CSV) for further analysis.

## Data Preparation
Once the data was collected, it underwent the following preparation steps:
1. **Data Analysis**: Conducted an initial analysis to identify key trends and patterns within the data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats to ensure consistency.
3. **Data Transformation**: Created calculated fields in Tableau for metrics such as total play counts, average song duration, and genre distribution.

## Visualizations
The dashboard features several key visualizations that provide insights into music trends:

1. **Popular Artists**:
   - This chart displays the top artists based on their overall popularity across the selected countries. It allows users to quickly identify which artists are currently leading the charts and their respective rankings.

2. **Popular Songs**:
   - This visualization highlights the top songs in the Spotify charts, showcasing the highest-ranked tracks. Users can see how each song ranks and explore additional details such as artist and play count.

3. **Popularity Across Countries**:
   - This chart visualizes the performance of the top songs in various countries, providing a comparative view of how different songs are trending globally. It highlights regional preferences and helps identify songs that have widespread appeal.

4. **Performance Over Time**:
   - This line graph shows the performance trajectory of select songs over time, indicating how their popularity has fluctuated. Users can analyze trends and spot emerging hits, as well as understand the longevity of tracks on the charts.

Each of these visualizations is based on real-time data that reflects the top 200 songs across 25 different countries, offering a comprehensive view of current music trends.
